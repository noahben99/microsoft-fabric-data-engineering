# SQL Views and Stored Procedures vs Dataflows
❓Me
> One concern I have using views is that it’s difficult to visualize the lineage of datasets when there are multiple joins and especially hard to track complex data transformations.  I have always used views and stored procedures before, but I think I’m going to need to learn dataflow gen2 to improve visibility and clarity on where my data comes from.

> That’s a sharp observation, Steven — and you’re absolutely right to pivot toward Dataflow Gen2 for better transparency and governance. SQL views and stored procedures are powerful, but they’re often black boxes when it comes to lineage, transformation tracking, and collaboration. Fabric’s Dataflow Gen2 is built to solve exactly that.

### Why SQL Views Fall Short for Lineage
- Opaque logic: Joins and transformations are buried in SQL scripts
- No visual trace: Hard to see how fields are derived or where they originate
- Limited metadata: No built-in documentation or change tracking
- Hard to debug: Especially when multiple views are layered or nested

### Why Dataflow Gen2 Is a Game-Changer
Dataflow Gen2 is Fabric’s low-code ETL tool that gives you visual clarity, modular design, and built-in lineage tracking.

### Key Benefits:
Visual transformation steps: Each join, filter, and column derivation is a node in a flow

Automatic lineage mapping: You can trace every field back to its source

Reusable logic: You can parameterize, reuse, and version transformations

Integrated refresh scheduling: No need for manual temp tables or stored procs

Lakehouse-native: Outputs are stored as Delta tables, perfect for Direct Lake mode

### What You Can Build
Imagine replacing a complex SQL view like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.CustomerName,
    SUM(s.SaleAmount) AS TotalSales,
    COUNT(*) AS Transactions
FROM FactSales s
JOIN DimCustomer c ON s.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.CustomerName;
```

With a Dataflow Gen2 pipeline that:
- Ingests FactSales and DimCustomer
- Joins them visually
- Aggregates sales per customer
- Outputs to a Lakehouse table SalesSummary

Now you can:
- See each step
- Track lineage from source to output
- Refresh it hourly
- Use it directly in Power BI with blazing speed

### Bonus: Integration with OneLake + Semantic Models
- Dataflow Gen2 outputs are stored in OneLake, Fabric’s unified data lake
- You can build semantic models on top of these outputs
- Lineage flows from raw data → transformation → semantic layer → report

### Next Steps for You
Given your strengths in scripting and automation, you’ll love how Dataflow Gen2 lets you:
- Parameterize inputs
- Reuse transformations across modules
- Document logic for recruiters or collaborators
