**Create items with Fabric workloads**
After you create your Fabric enabled workspace, you can start creating items in Fabric. Each workload in Fabric offers different item types for storing, processing, and analyzing data. Fabric workloads include:

Data Engineering: Create lakehouses and operationalize workflows to build, transform, and share your data estate.
Data Factory: Ingest, transform, and orchestrate data.
Data Science: Detect trends, identify outliers, and predict values using machine learning.
Data Warehouse: Combine multiple sources in a traditional warehouse for analytics.
Databases: Create and manage databases with tools to insert, query, and extract data.
Industry Solutions: Use out-of-the-box industry data solutions.
Real-Time Intelligence: Process, monitor, and analyze streaming data.
Power BI: Create reports and dashboards to make data-driven decisions.
Fabric integrates capabilities from existing Microsoft tools like Power BI, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Azure Data Factory into a unified platform. Fabric also supports a data mesh architecture, allowing decentralized data ownership while maintaining centralized governance. This design eliminates the need for direct Azure resource access, simplifying data workflows.
