# Reasons to Create Multiple Lakehouses in Microsoft Fabric

## 1. Domain Separation
- Organize data by business domain (e.g., `Sales`, `Finance`, `Operations`)
- Enhances semantic clarity and discoverability
- Supports onboarding with intuitive folder structures

## 2. Decoupled Development
- Enables independent development across teams
- Reduces risk of schema collisions or accidental overwrites
- Facilitates modular deployment pipelines

## 3. Performance Optimization
- Smaller Lakehouses can be tuned individually
- Improves refresh times and transformation efficiency
- Avoids bottlenecks in large, monolithic Lakehouses

## 4. Governance and Access Control
- Apply workspace-level RBAC per Lakehouse
- Simplifies permission management and auditing
- Supports data privacy and compliance boundaries

## 5. Simplified ETL and Pipeline Management
- Each Lakehouse can have dedicated pipelines and Dataflows
- Easier to monitor, debug, and log ETL processes
- Enables modular changelog logging and onboarding documentation

## 6. Shortcut and Integration Flexibility
- Use OneLake shortcuts to reference shared data across Lakehouses
- Avoids duplication while maintaining semantic separation
- Enables cross-domain reporting without merging raw data

# ⚠️ Trade-Offs to Consider

| Factor               | Centralized Lakehouse | Multiple Lakehouses |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Unified model        | ✅ Easier               | ❌ Requires integration |
| Data duplication     | ✅ Avoided              | ❌ Possible for shared entities |
| Governance           | ❌ Complex              | ✅
