## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is both my **study log** and **public portfolio** for Microsoft Fabric.  
Over **6 weeks**, I’m combining structured learning, hands‑on builds, and governance best practices to strengthen my skills in:

- **Data ingestion & transformation** (SQL, PySpark, KQL)
- **Fabric governance & security** (RLS, CLS, sensitivity labels, Purview lineage)
- **Pipeline orchestration** (Data Factory in Fabric)
- **Performance tuning & monitoring**
- **Documentation for cross‑team clarity** (diagrams, playbooks, governance plans)

By the end, this repo will contain **production‑quality examples** of each Fabric component, plus the governance and documentation that make those solutions discoverable and trustworthy.
